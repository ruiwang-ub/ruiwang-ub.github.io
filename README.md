### Local Setup (Standard)

Assuming you have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) and [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) installed on your system (*hint: for ease of managing ruby gems, consider using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv)*).

```bash
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec jekyll serve --lsi
```

Now, feel free to customize the theme however you like (don't forget to change the name!).
After you are done, **commit** your final changes.
