  abstract    = { We propose a three-pronged framework to study discourses surrounding social media activism initiated by networked counterpublics: personalized expressions that share stories and support, demands for changes that address systematic problems, and contentions between various actors and perspectives. Situating our analysis in discourses related to sexual violence and gender justice activism on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Reddit, we use supervised machine learning to quantify three discourses—networked acknowledgment, calls to action, and feminism contention—and apply time series analysis to model their interrelations. Results show that networked acknowledgment stimulated both calls to action and feminism contention and that calls to action predicted feminism contention across all platforms. These discourses were more sensitive to real-world events on Twitter and Facebook, but more ephemeral and cyclical on Instagram and more persistent and coupled on Reddit. Our findings speak to the opportunities and challenges in social media activism and underscore cross-platform similarities and differences. },

  abstract    = { ABSTRACTAccording to the Great Replacement conspiracy theory, nonwhites, globalists and elites are plotting to eliminate the white race and its dominance through anti-white policies and increased immigration. In that context, abortion among white women is perceived by white nationalists (WN) as a betrayal of their ‘biological’ and ‘traditional’ gender role – procreation of white babies. While WN condemn abortion among white women as a murderous sin, at times they encourage the practice among nonwhites to solve demographic threats to white dominance. In this study, we use mixed methods, combining unsupervised machine learning with close textual analysis of 30,725 posts including the term ‘abortion’ published on the WN website Stormfront between 2001 and 2017. We identify three broad themes: White genocide, focused on the conspiracy theory and detailing the active actors in its alleged execution; political, focused on political agendas and laws; and WN reproductive reasoning, articulating and justifying the contradiction between supporting abortion for nonwhites but not for whites via politics of difference that emphasize nonwhites’ supposed inferior morality. We discuss WN’s unique and explicitly racist discourse around a medical topic like abortion, a staple of the conservative and religious right for decades, and how it is used to alleviate their cognitive dissonance resulting from their dual-stance on abortion. Such discourse could be harnessed to recruit members into the movement and normalize extreme, racist ideologies. },

  abstract    = { AbstractPrevious studies have suggested that dating app use can foster acceptance of the controversial idea of algorithm matchmaking. However, an integrated framework to explain this relationship is lacking. To address this gap, this study proposes a familiarity-breeds-trust hypothesis, which suggests that dating app use can increase trust in dating algorithms by raising algorithm awareness and enhancing perceived agency. To test this hypothesis, the current work employed an exploratory sequential mixed-methods design. Study 1 interviewed 19 dating app users and identified four types of critical algorithm perceptions that reflected perceived threats to user agency. Study 2 surveyed 371 users of Tantan—a mainstream Chinese dating app that resembles Tinder—and found a positive relationship between Tantan use and trust in dating algorithms. Additionally, Tantan use was positively related to algorithm awareness, which was negatively related to critical algorithm perceptions. Furthermore, critical algorithm perceptions negatively predicted trust in dating algorithms. The findings provide support for the familiarity-breeds-trust hypothesis. Theoretical implications for future human-algorithm interaction studies and practical suggestions are also discussed. },
